### CPSC 120

* Lab 1, part 1
    Lab 1, Part 1, is a favorite of mine, because I see it as an iconic thing. I think that “Hello, World!” is simple, but the fact that such a simple statement is still used brings me a sense of pride in this kind of work. Doing it at the time was like solving a simple puzzle, and I enjoyed that. Looking back on how I used to consider it complicated is endearing as well. I see it as the beginning of my learning journey.

* Lab 5, part 2
    Lab 5 part 2 also stood out to me a lot because it was the first time programming that I was able to truly let something click. It was a simple tool that let you program in a blackjack scoring system. I love blackjack, so I really enjoyed picking apart one of my favorite card games. It challenged me a lot, in ways that I wasn't used to, but being able to overcome it with my partner was very gratifying. I think it cemented my interest in the field a lot more. 

* Lab 6, part 2
    The final lab that stood out to me the most was Lab 6, part 2. Lab 6 involves working with mathematics, translating the arithmetic mean equation into C++. I like the puzzle-esque design of picking apart an equation that I have used dozens of times already. It taught me that c++ has so many layers and depth to it that, even when I think I am getting a handle on things, there is much more for me to learn.
