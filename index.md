### CPSC 120

* Lab 1, part 1
    Lab 1, Part 1, is a favorite of mine, because I see it as an iconic thing. I think that “Hello, World!” is simple, but the fact that such a simple statement is still used brings me a sense of pride in this kind of work.

* Lab 5, part 2
    Lab 5 part 2 also stood out to me a lot because it was the first time programming that I was able to truly let something click. It challenged me a lot, in ways that I wasn't used to, but being able to overcome it with my partner was very gratifying, and I think it cemented my interest in the field a lot more.

* Lab 6, part 2
    The final lab that stood out to me the most was Lab 6, part 2. Lab 6 involves working with mathematics, translating the arithmetic mean equation into C++. It kind of opened my eyes as to how far you can really take code, in ways that I hadn't really thought of. I have plenty to learn.
